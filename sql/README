If you intend to use the Simple containers you only need perm_db_simple.sql, but if you go for the Medium containers you'll need both perm_db_simple.sql and perm_db_medium.sql.

Same goes with Complex, then you need, perm_db_(simple && medium && complex).sql


This is only a basic readme which could be extended into something a lot bigger, for example describing why you'd need the medium container and etc. this has often be done on the mailinglist at http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.pear.liveuser

if anyone cares to write this thing up, please do so and email us to the mailinglist or post it to pear.limbourg.com (a link or the whole thing.)

We'll still maintain perm_db.sql for the next few releases, and then finally remove it.
