How to setup the examples

For every example found in this directory you need to create a database
and run the schema dumps first.

They can be found in

  PEAR_DATA_DIRECTORY/liveuser/misc/schema/
  
Import perm_mdb_schema.xml and auth_mdb_schema.xml into the database using the install.php.
  
After those two steps you can run the dumps found in every "example" directory.

THOSE DUMPS CONTAIN ONLY DATA AND WILL FAIL IF YOU DO NOT RUN THE SCHEMA DUMPS FIRST
