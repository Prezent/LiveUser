How to setup the examples

For every example found in this directory you need to create a database
and run the schema dumps first.

They can be found in

  PEAR_DATA_DIRECTORY/liveuser/misc/schema/
  
Import perm_db_(simple|medium|complex).sql and Auth_DB.sql into the database.
  
After those two steps you can run the dumps found in every "example" directory.

THOSE DUMPS CONTAIN ONLY DATA AND WILL FAIL IF YOU DO NOT RUN THE SCHEMA DUMPS FIRST

Note!
some examples require only perm_db_simple, others require perm_db_simple && perm_db_medium and so on,
we recommend you just import then all, if that's not desired then look at each example and in their readme file or index.html
you'll find the requirement of which of those files are needed.
P.S.
perm_db.sql containing all data from perm_db_(simple|medium|complex).sql will be maintained for some time but we don't recommend
using that file anymore.
